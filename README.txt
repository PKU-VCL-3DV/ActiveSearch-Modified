Please download data.zip at https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ZwfQTMxHbFGXqWrbP_OG-DKWbNWZrx1/view?usp=sharing, and unzip it at current directory to make a path like "./7s/heads".
Then use command "cd 7s && chmod +x fast_test.sh && ./fast_test.sh clusters.12k.txt" to run Active Search and to calculate median error.
What's more, if you want to use your own Active Search program, please edit "7s/fast_test.sh" and change the variable "as_path" to the directory of your executable binary file "acg_localizer_active_search" and "compute_desc_assignments".
Please contact with us if there is any problem.
Thank you!
